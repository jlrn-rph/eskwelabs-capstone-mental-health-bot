# Eskwelabs Capstone Project: BESHY - Bot for Emotional Support and a Happy You
This project is created by team JARDiS. We are a group of individuals from diverse backgrounds who came together as part of the Eskwelabs Data Science Cohort 11. In our capstone project, we collaborated to create a data-driven presentation on mental health entitled [Beyond the Numbers of Mental Health: Analyzing Reddit Posts on Mental Health in the Philippines and Developing BESHY (Bot for Emotional Support and a Happy You)](https://github.com/jlrn-rph/eskwelabs-capstone-mental-health).

This repository contains the code for BESHY, a conversational AI system designed to provide emotional support and resources for individuals with mental health concerns. The chatbot is developed using Rasa. It employs natural language understanding and machine learning techniques to understand user inputs and provide appropriate responses. With empathetic dialogue handling, the chatbot offers guidance, coping strategies, and information on mental health topics such as anxiety and depression. It aims to create a safe and supportive environment for users to express their feelings and seek help.

*Note: ⚠️ We want to emphasize that the chatbot is not intended to be a substitute for professional advice, diagnosis, or treatment. It only provides information to get you started with reaching out to a qualified mental health professional. Ensuring privacy and maintaining ethical practices are also essential for our chatbot. We don't save any information from the user for we respect their privacy and solely aim to provide valuable resources and support.* 

## Features
* Classifies user thoughts and emotions, offering relevant resources and coping strategies for anxiety and depression.
* Flags high-risk suicidal thoughts and provides immediate support and resources.
* Utilizes geocoding to recommend the nearest mental health facility based on the user's location, ensuring access to professional help when needed.

## Recommendations for Improvement
* Enhance the chatbot's natural language understanding capabilities to better interpret complex user inputs and handle a wider range of mental health concerns. 
    * Make the chatbot be able to respond in Filipino for inclusivity.
* Incorporate a feedback mechanism to collect user feedback and continuously improve the chatbot's performance and user experience.
    * Consult with mental health professionals and collaborate with existing initiatives.
* Integrate with external APIs or databases to provide real-time and up-to-date information on mental health resources, support groups, and therapy options.
* Incorporate privacy measures to ensure the security and confidentiality of sensitive user information.
